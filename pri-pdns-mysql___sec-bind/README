Basic setup to have PowerDNS as catalog-zone master server:
using two triggers which add the PTR records

* Server *
Besides having 127.0.0.1 add 127.0.0.2 

* MySQL *
Install MySQL server
Start it
Run the pdns.sql

* Bind *
Install Bind server
Replace named.conf - and check if values matches for you
Start it

* PowerDNS *
Install PowerDNS server
Replace pdns.conf
Start it

If all went well then the example domains are now being served by both PowerDNS and Bind.
One MySQL query like `DELETE FROM domains WHERE name='example.be'` will the domains and it's records from both.
