Basic setup to have PowerDNS as catalog-zone master server:
using two triggers which add the PTR records

* MySQL
Install MySQL server
Start it
Run the pdns.sql

* Bind
Install Bind server
Replace named.conf - and check if values matches for you
Start it

* PowerDNS
Install PowerDNS server
Replace pdns.conf
Start it

If all went well then the example domains are now being served by both PowerDNS and Bind.
One MySQL query like `DELETE FROM domains WHERE name='example.be'` will remove them at both.
